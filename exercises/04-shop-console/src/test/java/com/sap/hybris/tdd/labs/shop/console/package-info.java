// * add a product
// * add the same product multiple times
// * remove a product
// * remove all products
// * get a list of all added products

// TODO 02 implement three promotions responsible for counting a discount for a cart:

// * every third product for free (cheaper products are for free)
// * 30% discount on all products

// TODO 03 implement a mechanism that determines the total price of the cart,
// taking into account the most favorable promotion
